## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(choroplethr)
library(tidyverse)
library(choroplethrMaps)
library(data.table)
setwd("/Users/stutipandey/Practice Github")
getwd()
data<-fread("Bridge data.csv")
data=mutate(data,cond=min(DECK_COND_058,SUPERSTRUCTURE_COND_059,SUBSTRUCTURE_COND_060,CHANNEL_COND_061,CULVERT_COND_062,na.rm=T))
summary(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
